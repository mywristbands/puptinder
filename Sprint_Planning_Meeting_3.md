### Elias Heffan

What I have done: Researched how to use Firestore, planned the [layout of our database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wh2Bb0nTlIzK-a9Kbr89DsQotLfsNNRN/view?usp=sharing), set up API function prototypes for
interacting with database from View Controllers ([here](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/56d3fe3be28966d55ecc2da71cd6bc1c22230aec) and [here](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/1ca7b22f4748d3e3e07b7768815a9ce918fd790a)), and [fixed a couple visuals of View 
Controllers](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/ac34e9d23c003ad8a7f112f6367f6c34fed8eb93).

Any roadblocks: None.

What I plan to do: Meet with group to figure out how we'll divide up implementing the API functions and incorporating them into our app. Tammy and I will likely implement most of the API functions, and stay one step ahead of Hajra and Alannah who will be calling them in our app's View Controllers.

### Tammy Lee

What I have done: Connect Firebase onto our app. Discuss API endpoints that the front will call. Designed collection and document structure with Elias. Write security [rules](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/e195bad01ddca4b8032075c8dcc988bfee885e7b) on Firestore, which are not pushed to Github, but have some [operations](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/d2543bbe694f19862aaa524287e4ac55d3174ee0) on the Login that were used to test out rules.

Any roadblocks: None. 

What I plan to do: Continue implementing API functions since Elias just pushed updates to Api.swift. Continue working on messaging flow and seeing how I could possibly include calendar.

### Hajra Mobashar

What I have done: Worked on the UI Design of the app. Created the profile view. Split up create profile screen into multiple skipable steps. 

Any roadblocks: None at the moment.

What I plan to do: Create home view. Work on the dog api. Work on the get response for the dog api and prefil info for the user.

### Alannah Woodward

What I have done: [Worked on view controllers and implementation.](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/1ceea23536c524b1c2b57522884b9fe7ee0a4b55) [Post request to dog api server is working to upload image from phone](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/695177d7d0dc865cb6119bedcc8dd80d8947fa31).

Any roadblocks: None so far. 

What I plan to do: Get Dog API prefill working. Continue working on account storage on firebase.
