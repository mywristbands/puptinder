### Elias Heffan

What I have done: Researched how to use Firestore, started planning the layout
and rules of our database, worked on setting up API function prototypes for
interacting with database from View Controllers, [fixed a couple visuals of View 
Controllers](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/ac34e9d23c003ad8a7f112f6367f6c34fed8eb93).

Any roadblocks: Need another meeting with Tammy to discuss Firebase rules and data storage design in detail.

What I plan to do: Finish plannning out how we'll set up our database and rules,
finish setting up API function prototypes for interacting with database from
View Controllers, divide up with Tammy who will implement the API functions and
start working on implementing some of them.

### Tammy Lee

What I have done: Connect Firebase onto our app. Discuss API endpoints that the front will call. Designed collection and document structure with Elias. Write security rules on Firestore, which are not pushed to Github, but have some [operations](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/d2543bbe694f19862aaa524287e4ac55d3174ee0) on the Login that were used to test out rules.

Any roadblocks: None. 

What I plan to do: Continue implementing API functions since Elias just pushed updates to Api.swift. Continue working on messaging flow and seeing how I could possibly include calendar.

### Hajra Mobashar

What I have done: Worked on the UI Design of the app. Created the profile view. Split up create profile screen into multiple skipable steps. 

Any roadblocks: None at the moment.

What I plan to do: Create home view. Work on the dog api. Work on the get response for the dog api and prefil info for the user.

### Alannah Woodward

What I have done: [Worked on view controllers and implementation.](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/1ceea23536c524b1c2b57522884b9fe7ee0a4b55) [Post request to dog api server is working to upload image from phone](https://github.com/ECS189E/project-f19-puptinder/commit/695177d7d0dc865cb6119bedcc8dd80d8947fa31).

Any roadblocks: None so far.
