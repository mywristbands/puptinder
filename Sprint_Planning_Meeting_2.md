### Elias Heffan

What I have done: Worked on App flow and Wireframe (linked above).

Any roadblocks: None at the momemnt.

What I plan to do: Implement google login in client and server. 

### Tammy Lee

What I have done: Discuss app flow and wireframe with group. Read up on in-app messaging APIs such as Twilio, Socket.IO, Firebase Cloud Messaging. Firebase seems like the best option since we are also using it for storage.

Any roadblocks: None at the moment.

What I plan to do: Put firebase into our app and get stand alone in-app messaging to work. 

### Hajra Mobashar

What I have done: Researched google login options, helped modeling the app flow and UI Design of the app.

Any roadblocks: None at the moment.

What I plan to do: Create UI stubs on storyboard for everyone to have a view to work with. These stubs are based off the diagram and flow we drew up on our last meeting. I will be implementing our brand/theme on storyboard now.

### Alannah Woodward

What I have done: Research about location usage, helped model the app flow and design documents. 

Any roadblocks: None so far. 

What I plan to do: Initially create app. Look into models for temporary profile. Work on profile view. Look into storage of accounts using firebase.
