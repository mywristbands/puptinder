### Alannah Woodward
I worked on the app ui flow and helped implement most of the view controllers. I also implemented the dog api calls to get the breed when uploading an image. I polished some views as well. 

### Tammy Lee
I worked closely with Elias to plan out database details and plan out custom API functions that we would have to write. We each worked on roughly half of the API functions. I also created the view for matches and conversations and connected it to the message view.

### Elias Heffan
I planned out the structure and rules of our database with Tammy, and I came up with all the Api function prototypes that I predicted we would need to build our app.
I worked on implementing many of these Api functions: specifically all the Api.profile functions, some Api.auth functions, some of the Api.matches() function, and some of the Api.messages() functions.
I also created a javascript function that is run in the cloud called checkForMatchOnSwipeRight(), which is responsible for automatically finding and creating matches.
Finally, I implemented the messagesView (the one where you chat with other people).
