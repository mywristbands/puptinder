### Alannah Woodward
I worked on the app ui flow and helped implement most of the view controllers. I also implemented the dog api calls to get the breed when uploading an image. I polished some views as well. 

### Tammy Lee
I worked closely with Elias to plan out database details and plan out custom API functions that we would have to write. We each worked on roughly half of the Api functions. I also created the view for matches and conversations and connected it to the message view.

We all contributed to some form of general bug fixing, account creating, and testing.
