### Alannah Woodward
I worked on the app ui flow and helped implement most of the view controllers. I also implemented the dog api calls to get the breed when uploading an image. I polished some views as well.

I planned out the structure and rules of our database with Tammy, and I came up with all the Api function prototypes that I predicted we would need to build our app.
I worked on implementing many of these Api functions: specifically all the Api.profile functions, some Api.auth functions, some of the Api.matches() function, and some of the Api.messages() functions.
I also created a javascript function that is run in the cloud called checkForMatchOnSwipeRight(), which is responsible for automatically finding and creating matches.
Finally, I implemented the messagesView (the one where you chat with other people).
